### Setting goals and mapping the space

We set goals with my friend Arindam to submit a paper at NeurIPS 2024, and the deadline is the 17th of May. It was the 10th of February and we didn't even had a subject yet.

So naturally, we started finding areas of common interest to tackle. I really want to do something either in Neural Architecture Search, Meta-Learning, Transfer-Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Arindam is very interested in the mathematical properties of Neural Networks, pruning and compression methods for Network representation and information extraction.


### What is Neural Architecture Search?

To really understand where to start, i stumbled upon this great [survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08727) ,with Frank Hutter as an author, one of the leading experts in the field, summing up very well what has been tried. And a very clear mapping of the problem space.
